# Old Stack


```bash
# compile
make

# clean up generated files
make clean
```


**Data structure written in C**

A simple stack that takes input from the user and stores it into the stack.


- input type: integer value, and string text

- submitting an empty integer value will cause the program to finish the input process (zero is not an empty value)

- the end of program will also call the print function to display all data stored in the stack
